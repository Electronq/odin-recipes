    <p><h3>Instructions:</h3></p>
    <p>Start out by prepping the chicken. Simply place the breasts between two pieces of plastic cling wrap or aluminium foil and pound them down to an even thickness. If you own a meat mallet then go ahead and pull that out. I personally just use my rolling pin to bash the meat down and I find it works just as well. Pounding the chicken will allow it to cook more evenly and make for more tender chicken in the end.</p>
